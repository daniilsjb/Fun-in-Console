# Asteroids

My implementation of the Asteroids game, inspired by javidx9's Code-It-Yourself video. This demo uses matrix transformations on vector graphics to draw objects, as well as simple physics engine to match the original game's controls.

*Requires "ConsoleGameEngine.h"*<br/>
*Note: DrawPoint method of the ConsoleGameEngine must be virtual.*
